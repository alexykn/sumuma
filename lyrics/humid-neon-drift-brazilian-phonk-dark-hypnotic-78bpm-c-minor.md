[Intro – Humid neon pads + lo‑fi chops]
(vinyl crackle, distant traffic)
(PT‑BR chop, pitched down) "noite quente… ninguém dorme…"
(formant‑shift) "tô perdido na neon, chama, chama…"
[rhythmic gate breathing, pre‑sidechain]

[Verse 1 – Half‑murmur, hypnotic]
Fogged glass, asphalt rain, bass slide like thunder
Ghosts in the tamborzão swing, hats blur and stutter
Phone glow on my face, city hum under
Detuned bends in my head, then glass bells shimmer
Slow drag, 78, lungs taste the summer
Glitch fill cuts the room, clap flam like a runner

[Pre – Build, filter rise]
Hands on the rail, hear the room start pumping
Moog growl low while the Juno stays humming
FM stars in the dark keep coming
(reverse swell… hold)

[Drop/Hook – PT‑BR vocal chops, side‑chained]
(cut‑up) "vem comigo" / "bate forte" / "sente o grave"
(pitched) "coração no 808… 8‑0‑8…"
Noite afunda no grave, eu flutuo na onda
Chão treme, som sujo, boca morde a sombra
(call/response chop) "fica" / "não foge" / "me encontra"

[Verse 2 – Smoke‑low, cinematic]
Tape hiss on the lips, words blur to color
Bass smear, lane change, skyline grows duller
Slide up, scrape down, then the kick gets rougher
Neon sweat on the floor, crowd sway like water
Eyes half‑closed, I count the lights getting longer
(glitch fill) tik‑tik— snap — back stronger

[Breakdown – Tape stop + reverse swells]
(tape stop) breath on steel, room turns slower
(reverse pad bloom) memory pulls closer
FM bell flicker, heartbeat over and over

[Final Hook – Wide/loud, chopped PT‑BR]
(stacked) "vem comigo" / "noite quente" / "bate forte"
I sink in the low, ride the ghost in the groove
808 writes my pulse, every street light moves
(formant‑shift) "ninguém dorme… chama…"
[Outro – Gate fade, pads exhale]
