[Intro – Detuned radio, vinyl hiss]
[sample: "are you still dreaming?"] [low, distant]
Dial tone, dust tone [bitcrushed]
Red lights, dead phone

[Verse 1 – Whisper/growl, behind the beat]
Night shift, knife shift
Cold code, life drift
Black tape, backspace
Erase face, save gist
Ghost cache, sold pasts
Glass mask, slow fast
Plug veins, drain sleep
Trade heat, make deep
Wire hum, choir numb
Siren drum, iron lung
Vault chill, fault spill
Spill ink, still will
Blank eyes, bank lies
Thin ice, thin skies
Chip grin, sin grin
Key spins, we spin

[Pre-Hook – Filter sweep, tension]
Hands out, palms gray
Pay now, fade day
Soft knock, soft code
Door breathes, floor groans

[Hook – Heavy sub, wide reverb]
Memory market, cash for ghosts
Buy your thunder, sell your bones
Dreams on layaway, sleep on loan
Wake with edges, names unknown
[uh] [spaced ad-libs]
[mmm] [tape wobble]

[Verse 2 – Clipped consonants, closer mic]
Black light, scan proof
Past leaks through the roof
Blue smear, fuse fear
New gear, lose years
Gold tooth, cold booth
Truth loops, booth proofs
Code rash, ash bloom
Perfume, back room
Trade scars for stars
Barcodes for bars
Hush hush, rush hush
Pulse crushed, drums crushed
Thick smoke, sick oath
Ink notes, sink boats

[Breakdown – Half-time, reverse tails]
Slow chant, low chant
No saints, no grants
Room tilts, doom wilts
Thin silk, thick guilt
[shh] [reverse reverb]

[Hook – Drop hits late]
Memory market, cash for ghosts
Buy your thunder, sell your bones
Dreams on layaway, sleep on loan
Wake with edges, names unknown
[hold] [wide, airy]

[Bridge – Spoken, granular]
I flip static into habits
Trade panic for a packet
Wrap fractures in a jacket
Then I stack it, then I stack it
Dead channels, fed panels
Red candles, bed vandals
Dark ledger, arc pressure
Lost measure, false treasure

[Hook – Final, distorted]
Memory market, cash for ghosts
Buy your thunder, sell your bones
Dreams on layaway, sleep on loan
Wake with edges, names unknown
Fade in fragments, paid in tones
Keep the night, leave the home

[Outro – Tape stop, sub decay]
Dial tone, dial gone
One breath, light yawn
[click] [power down]
