[Intro – Dark Piano Loop + Vinyl Crackle]
(Yeah... uh-huh... check it)
[whispered with reverb] In these streets where the shadows fall
(—record scratch—) [cuts to main beat]

[Verse 1 – Aggressive Flow, Raw Delivery]
Started from the bottom, now the game got me twisted
Concrete jungle where the weak don't make the hit list
Money, power, respect - that's the trinity of sin
Hustle through the darkness, let the violence begin

Street lights flicker like my conscience in the night
Paranoia creeping, gotta keep my circle tight
Enemies disguised as friends with smiles on their face
One wrong move and it's bullets flying all over the place

[Hook – Deep Male Vocal, Echoed + Compressed]
These streets don't love nobody (nobody)
Cold world, can't trust nobody (nobody)
(—gunshot sample—) [timed with snare]
Blood money in my pocket, soul darker than the night
These streets don't love nobody (nobody)

[Verse 2 – Rapid Fire, Menacing Tone]
Chrome reflecting moonlight as I grip it with precision
Every decision calculated, this ain't superstition
Rivals plotting on my throne but they don't understand
Built this empire with these bullets and these bloody hands

Sirens in the distance but they'll never catch me slipping
Money laundering operations, offshore account shipping
From the projects to the penthouse, still remember where I'm from
War-torn memories haunting till the battle's finally won

[Bridge – Pitched Down Vocal, Haunting]
(Death around the corner...) [echoed, distant]
Can you feel it in the air tonight?
(Blood on the concrete...) [whispered]
When the streets claim another life

[Verse 3 – Slower, More Menacing]
They say karma's a bitch but I make my own luck
Silver spoon kids don't know about being stuck
In the gutter where survival is the only game played
Where loyalty gets tested and debts must be paid

Crown heavy on my head but I earned every jewel
Sacrificed my innocence to make it through this cruel
World of backstabbers, fake friends and betrayal
Now I'm writing my legacy in blood without fail

[Outro – Fading Piano, Distant Sirens]
These streets... they made me who I am
(—police radio chatter—) [fading in background]
[whispered] In the end, we all just trying to survive...
(—heartbeat sample—) [slowing, then silence]
