[Intro – detuned choir drones + vinyl static + cassette hiss]
[Tempo: 92 BPM, dark phonk; distorted sub gnarl; tape wobble; heavy sidechain; scratch FX stabs; bitcrush on ad-libs; formant-shift whispers]

Cold brass, cold cash, cold corridors, coded orders
Ghost contracts in folders, signatures colder than mortars
Stock ticks sync with rockets, coffers cough when coffins close
Boardrooms toast in low-lit glow while borders erode in rows
Budget blooms like bruise-tone hues, blue suits spin blood to growth
Paper cuts on prayer books, the numbers numb a nation’s oath
Flag stitched over payroll, halo sold as haloed hope
Halo drops? The halo’s broke; the payload spoke in plumes of smoke
Lobby tongues lacquered in lacquer-thick jargon, jar the truth
Bunker-laughs, blank memos, then bang—new bids for armored proof
Desert sands to riverbeds, ribbon cuts on ruined schools
Revolving doors revolve again: generals chair the boards they rule
Tin medals in tin briefcases, tinny speeches, TV grin
Spin doctrine, spin turbines; windfall winds blow war within
Every line item line-dances, fine print finds a way to win
When the sirens sing for sirens, the violin is the violin

[Hook – chopped chant, vocoder layer, gang vox, DJ cuts]
Cold steel, warm profit; cold steel, warm profit
We watch the bonds rocket, they lock it, then launder the logic
Cold steel, warm profit; cold steel, warm profit
If the peace won’t turn a margin, they margin-call the conflict

[Scratch FX cue: “follow the money” – staggered cuts]

[Verse 2 – doubled lead, formant lows on tail words]
Offshore whispers, onshore whispers, offshore figures offshore fixtures
Think tanks thank banks; blank checks paint scriptures
Clerks file clouds; loud plows carve pixels from the news
Fuse truth to ad views; blues bruised, choose cues to soothe crews
Paper planes take aim, signed in fountain-ink and fountain drinks
Aid convoys flanked by brand-new rifles; that’s the missing link
Mercury in the thermometer: fever for procurement nights
Quarterlies applaud artillery; quarterly report the rights
Silhouettes on senate walls, silhouettes on village walls
Different fonts, same intent: dividends on vigil calls
Quiet part confessed inside a footnote at the bottom
“Stability requires volatility”—they bought ’em and then they taught ’em
Weathervanes point to profit rain; the thunder’s in the ledger
Ethics edited in red—and red is trending, check the measure
Broken treaties, open meetings, closed captions hide the harm
Promise peace in palisade prose; pull pins with polished charm

[Hook – chopped harder, call/response, stereo spread]
Cold steel, warm profit; cold steel, warm profit
They mark up every margin while martyrs march into pockets
Cold steel, warm profit; cold steel, warm profit
If ceasefire isn’t paying, they cease filing the docket

[Breakdown – low-pass filter sweep, tape stop, bitcrush ramp]
Follow the money till the trail turns black, then vanishes
Hollow in the honey where the tax breaks brand the savages
Powder on the handshake, powder burns in paragraphs
Counter any outrage with a counter-offer, paragraph

[Verse 3 – cadence switch, triplet inner-rhymes, whispered ad-libs]
Backroom backgammon: black granite tables, stacks and gavel taps
Battle maps on napkins; contractors draft the aftermath
After cash, the caskets stack; they package that as “strategic”
Semantics sanitize the stain; semantics make it collegiate
City grit and village grit—grit teeth grind in syndication
Syndicates syndicate sins through cables of syndication
Dissonant dividends glisten when missiles twist to ignition
Listen: a mission’s definition shifts with fiscal ambition
Mothers pray in mother tongues; the thunder tongues statistics
Analysts angle angels into angles that look realistic
Hands wash hands in fountains forged from funding floods and wishes
Peace signs on press lines, press time sold in polished dishes

[Hook – chopped, chopped, chopped; crowd layer, distortion push]
Cold steel, warm profit; cold steel, warm profit
The spreadsheet’s where the speeches live; receipts sing like prophets
Cold steel, warm profit; cold steel, warm profit
If truth won’t pass the balance test, they balance out the topics

[Outro – vinyl crackle up, sub fades, distant siren texture]
No names, but the names know; no saints in the payroll
When the payload paints the dayglow, watch the halo drain slow
Write the ledger, write the letters, let the weather vein show
Till the weathered veils tear open and the levees say “no”
