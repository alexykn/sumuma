[Intro – Humid Neon Pads + Lo‑Fi PT‑BR Chops] [wide Juno pad, room verb, vinyl hiss]
(sample, chopped: "noite quente… neon molhado…") [soft, detuned]
Streetlights bleed on the hood like a phantom stain,
Glass drips rain in a loop, I loop my brain.
Backseat bass breathes, lungs full of city steam,
Night tastes metal and mint, I swallow the dream.

[Pre‑Drop – Reverse Swell + Tape Stop] [side‑chain ramp, gate opens]
I hear the ghosts in the grid when the meters peak,
Every second stretched thin like a late‑night leak.
Hands on the wheel, pulse in a crooked swing,
Shadow on my shoulder said, “say less—let it ring.”

[Drop / Hook – PT‑BR Vocal Chops, Pitched/Formant‑Shifted] [crunchy clap flams, fast hats, tamborzão ghosts, 808 slides]
(chop: "tô na noite, sem medo, sem freio")
(chop: "pele quente, vidro neon, som cheio")
(chop: "vem com calma, respira, deixa que eu veio")
(chop: "sem prometer, só sentir… eu meio")
[side‑chain pumping hard, Moog mono growl under]
Noite dobra, beats sobram, rua dobra comigo,
Sinal corta, mente morde, destino é perigo.
Vozes giram, vidro vibra, céu vira abrigo,
Quando o grave arrasta a alma, eu nem volto comigo.

[Verse 1 – Detuned Dark Bends → Bright FM Plucks] [FM bells glassy, subtle delay]
City hum under gums, I grind the static,
Tunnel lights flip frames—flicker cinematic.
Lean with the lean code, scene goes erratic,
Breath syncs side‑chains; faith feels pneumatic.
Midnight map on my lap, lines cross faded,
Every plan in my palm, ink ghost‑graded.
Rim tint blues, I bruise what’s overstated,
Truth in the booth got proof—overweighted.
Slow step, 78 drips—heart on the click,
Gold teeth of the skyline bite through the brick.
I talk low to the engine: “don’t stall, don’t trip,”
It answers with a growl and a venomous slip.

[Pre‑Hook – Cinematic Lift] [reverse swells, hall verb bloom]
Breath fog on the glass draws maps to the dawn,
I trace what I chase, then I let it be gone.
Hunger in a hum that the thunder can’t drown,
Shadow in a crown, but we never bow down.

[Hook – PT‑BR Chops, Hypnotic Refrain] [wider, louder]
(chop: "noite quente, eu sumo, eu volto")
(chop: "coração bate no asfalto, eu solto")
(chop: "fica perto, mas não toca o rosto")
(chop: "só o grave, o gosto, eu posto")
Luz queimada, rua cheia, mente em mergulho,
Chama fria, chama feia, corta barulho.
Quando a batida me puxa, eu perco orgulho,
Deixo o peito no piso, o resto eu acumulo.

[Verse 2 – Swinged Tamborzão Ghosts + Glitch Fills] [Moog mono, rhythmic gates]
Scar tissue on the kick, hard‑panned scars,
Clock slips in a clip of collapsing bars.
I stitch nights to the rim of these passing cars,
Pray quiet to the noise, then I aim for stars.
Gravel in the vowels, vowels on fire,
Half‑tone halos float over live wire.
I breathe in brake lights, exhale a choir,
Flip fate on a plate, no hired squire.
Underpass sermons from stains on stone,
Street preachers of chrome preach “make it your own.”
I nod to the nods in the metronome,
Home is a hum in the headphones’ dome.

[Bridge – Tape Stop → Reverse Bloom] [claps flam, grit rises]
(tape stop)
All that weight on my chest goes feather for a second,
Then the second gets stretched and the echo gets beckoned.
I don’t text back time—I let the present reckon,
When the city says “jump,” I lace the loss, step in.

[Hook – PT‑BR Chops, Pitched Down + Formant Up] [thunderous low end]
(chop: "tô no breu, mas eu vejo o caminho")
(chop: "meu segredo é o som, meu vizinho")
(chop: "se eu sumir, eu retorno sozinho")
(chop: "grave guia, destino, vizinho")
Close call in the crawl, I don’t name the fear,
I let the frame smear, keep the flame near.
Hums in the gums, taste the tin of the year,
Every tear goes airborne—rain learns to cheer.

[Outro – Wide Pads + Distant Hats] [analog warmth, wide/loud mix]
If the road writes me wrong, I edit in motion,
Let the ocean of noise find a coast in devotion.
Breaths count like bills, but I pay with emotion,
When the tape rolls back, I’m a ghost in slow potion.
(reverse swell, fade)
