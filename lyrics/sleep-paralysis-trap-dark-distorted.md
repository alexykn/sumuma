[Intro – Air hiss + Sub Drone]
[sample: "don't move."] [pitched down, looped]
Clock clicks thick. Room hums.
Red dot blinks. Breath drums.

[Verse 1 – Half‑whisper, close‑mic]
Sheets clamp. Chest locked.
Breath stuck. Nerves shocked.
Ceiling swims, paint flakes.
Static snakes, bed shakes.
Pinned flat. Pins prickle.
Thin laugh. Skin tickle.
Shadow sits, knees folded.
Night folds, time’s molded.
Cold oil in my joints.
Blood boils, void points.
“Stay still.” Voice braided.
Grain, hiss, bass weighted.
Parade of eyes, no face.
Fade inside, slow chase.
He trades my fear for focus.
We ghost. The world’s out‑of‑focus.

[Pre‑Hook – Filters sweep, gate]
Don’t fight. Don’t flee.
Black tide on me.
Thin line. Thin sleep.
He signs. I keep.

[Hook – Detuned, layered, wide]
We made a pact in the dark.
Mark on my heart, little spark.
Teeth in the tar, leave a mark.
Breathe through the arc, ride the stark.

[Verse 2 – Broken flow, offset ad‑libs]
Stiff jaw. Slow panic.
Still shore. Low manic.
Stare stuck on the crown.
Air’s cut, iron sound.
He hums: “Borrow vision.”
I drum hollow decisions.
Trade sleep for precision.
Play deep premonitions.
Street lamps blur, melt chrome.
Heat amps purr, felt home.
I see routes, no map.
Key codes, slow taps.
Back doors unlatch silent.
Black chords scratch violent.
Safe clicks. Cash quiet.
Faint bliss, ash diet.

[Bridge – Distant choir, ring mod]
Astral tether, leather tight.
Every feather, weathered night.
Echo letters, better lies.
Pressure measured, sever ties.

[Hook – Heavier sub, crushed hats]
We made a pact in the dark.
Mark on my heart, little spark.
Teeth in the tar, leave a mark.
Breathe through the arc, ride the stark.

[Verse 3 – Confessional, thin verb]
Sun leaks. Curtains bleed.
Tongue weak. Words seed.
Day’s bright, still buzzing.
Veins write, grill humming.
He whispers: “One more.”
I answer: “What for?”
He counters: “Control.”
I falter: “My soul?”
A nod like a knife.
Odd calm in the strife.
I sign with a blink.
Fine line on the sink.
Cold mirror fogs symbols.
Old terror turns simple.
Two breaths, one rhythm.
New depth, dark prism.

[Outro – Tape wobble, alarms bend]
[alarm bleeds into 808]
I wake, but I don’t.
I shake, but I won’t.
We wait between ticks.
He waits in the mix.
If sleep is a sea,
He’s reef under me.
No light, still intact.
I keep. Our pact.
