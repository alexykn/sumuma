[Intro – Distorted radio, vinyl crackle, DJ scratches, pitch-shifted doubles]
Dial tone drone in a boarded-up borough, rusted shutters rattle with the thunder of the buses
Tax lien letters like nettles in the knuckles of the hustlers, city hall mumbling numbers in the gutters
Auctioneer cadence taps gavels on the gravel of our gravelly throats, we choke, then laugh at their quotes
Graffiti ghosts soap the bricks with names they stole, deeds folded like origami into gold

[Beat Note – Sub-bass overdriven, kick-slap, snare-sizzle, tape wow]

[Verse 1 – Low formant lead, octave-up whisper shadow]
Predatory paragraphs in paragraphs, paragraphing parasitic graphs, map red lines like artery paths
Carpetbag carry-on, cameras flash, cashmere mask, handshake polished like a lobbyist’s glass
City clerk flipping scripts, clicking bids, clicking pens, slick with gin, under-skin grins, discipline thin
Notice on the noticeboard, notice how they hoard hope, board homes, board votes, board throats
Sirens in the sirloin of the night cut deep, grease-stained timepiece losing seconds in the heat
Board meeting bored demons pour seasons of deceit, bleach smell seeping through a corridor of grief
We speak in meter, meet the meter-maid at meters, feeding meters, see the meter for the meters that they keep
Receipts re-seated, re-seeded, weeds in the leases, legalese leeches in a thesis about peace
Grandma’s porch swing sings through the splinters, winter whispers through a window dressed in splintered splinters
Blueprints bent like knuckles after winters, fingerprints smudged by lenders, tendered bids from sinners
I thread sentences through fences, tense and present, essence pressing through the press kit, blessed but restless
Turn the compressor to confess this: neighborhoods are necklaces, stripped and repossessed for breakfast

[Scratch Fill – Slice a bar with pay up, cough, pay up]

[Hook – Screw-voice chant with chopped echoes]
Raise the rent, erase the roots, then praise the suits
They claim the truth, but tailor proof in paper noose
We pace the stoops, we brace the boots, we break the loops
Distorted bass in the basement moves, the faith improves

[Hook Tag – Crowd layer, call-and-response]
If the deed in your hand ain’t clean then you can’t claim land
If the street in your plan ain’t seen then your maps ain’t grand

[Scratch Break – Transformer cuts, siren stab]

[Verse 2 – Mid formant, double-time fragments, alternating timbre]
Shadow cabinet habits inhabit ballots, tally malice, phalanx of palaces balanced on pallets
Pallets of pamphlets, pamphlets of promises, powdered in polish, demolished in policy
Developers develop the devil’s envelope, note folded tight like a choke in a rope
A slope in the slope where the soap won’t cope, hope floats low when the boat gets towed
Foreclose folklore, old oaks bulldozed, cold chrome photos posed with bold logos
Sold codes posted on a pole with a barcode, scan that soul to a landlord cargo
Who told y’all progress means a coffee shop on every corner while the corner store mourners get warned off
They turned our block to an off-shore office, offshore profits, on-shore losses
I keep a ledger in the letters I deliver, every river in the city got a shiver when they split it with a sliver of glitter
Riddles in a riddle, scribbles in the middle, brittle little fiddles over brittle civil signals
I make a covenant with cousins and the cousins of the cousins, hold a summit in the summer heat buzzing
Under sodium light, we solder our lives, shoulders collide, we mold what’s alive, we won’t privatize pride
Syllables like sickles in thistles, whistle through pistols of officials with initials on missiles
Still, we build with bricks of breath, debt pressed on the chest, we bench-press stress till the bench breaks next

[Vocal Chop Cue – Cut last line into stutters, pitch up then drop]

[Bridge – Minimal drums, cathedral tail, spoken-sung cadence]
Boarded windows blink Morse in the midnight
Every dot, dash spells out sit tight
But we don’t sit, we sift rights from writs, ignite bricks like insight, rewrite the invite
Turn eviction into friction, turn friction into firelight

[Hook – Full stack, stereo widen, chorus kids tucked low]
Raise the rent, erase the roots, then praise the suits
They claim the truth, but tailor proof in paper noose
We pace the stoops, we brace the boots, we break the loops
Distorted bass in the basement moves, the faith improves

[Scratch Interlude – Sample cut of keep the block breathing, backspin]

[Verse 3 – Call-and-response layers, gritted delivery]
Call out the calculus: count casualties of capital’s appetites
Watch catalysts of callousness tally the lights
We calibrate the alleyways, rally the mics, alley-cat agility, fight in the night
When the bid hits, digits twist, gimmicks glisten, listen: liens lean into lives with precision
We bend prisms, send prisms of wisdom through prisons of cynicism, rhythm becomes incision
Tax sale signage like signage of a séance, dancing with the ledgers in a ledger-line trance
I’m a tenant with a tenet: tenants aren’t tenants of your penmanship’s menace
Penitence pending from the senate that sent us a sentence, but sentences end when we pen up a presence
Breathe deep, street sweep beep, then sleep creeps cheap when the heat leaks steep
We keep receipts, we seed the seeds, we knead the needs, we lead the leads

[Drop – Bass solo, sidechain pump, chopped vox stabs]

[Hook – Chant with megaphone texture]
Raise the rent, erase the roots, then praise the suits
They claim the truth, but tailor proof in paper noose
We pace the stoops, we brace the boots, we break the loops
Distorted bass in the basement moves, the faith improves

[Mantra – Faded, layered]
Not for sale, we alive, we stay, we rise
Not for sale, we alive, we stay, we rise

[Outro – Vinyl stop, reverb tail, faint radio clip]
Auctioneer echo melts into a hushed hum as shutters lift and morning cuts the dust
Our names painted permanent where the bulldozers couldn’t touch
