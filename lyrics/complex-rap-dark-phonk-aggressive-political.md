[Intro – vinyl hiss, chopped Memphis vox, DJ scratches hard L/R]
[Tape wobble in, sub warming, gate opening]

Basement pressure pressing plates until the plaster flakes
Casket bass, a blackened wave that makes the rafters shake
Mask the face, the past erased by static-lathered takes
Hands of fate on faders, phase the frame and shatter fakes

Razor rhythm, grit and prism, kick is clipping, still it hits
Syllables in figure-eights, I braid the limits till they split
City’s in my chest—concrete lungs and splintered bricks
Dinner’s in the distance, but this hunger’s where I live

[Scratch stabs – “ch-chk, ahh” layered with record crackle]
[Sub growl boost on bar 4]

Pressure blesses pessimists with lessons dressed in evidence
Levers bent, we wrestle rent, the devil’s debt is precedent
Ever since the ledger prints, we measure sense in sediment
Metal scent in weathered vents, I vent against the presidents

[Hook – pitch-down lead, doubled with helium highs; wide stereo]
This is dark phonk doctrine, coffin-deep drums knocking
Voice warps morph, then we torch false options
Scratch-blade boxing, vinyl ghosts talking
If the gate stays locked, we pick it with the dropping

[Post-Hook – crowd-width chant, short and raw]
Knock, knock — bassline — break that lock
Knock, knock — bassline — shake that block

[Verse 2 – cadence switch, double-time bursts, slight distortion]
Counterclock the meter till the seconds sound mechanical
Hammer tone, anvil soul, anthem in the radicals
Candle-glow in catacombs, grammar load is tactical
Hand it to the amateurs? Nah, we craft sabbaticals

Backspin facts in, truth with a crackle
Sample of a sermon meets a siren in the rafters
Laughter from the masters turns to fractures in the plaster
After every chapter comes a faster set of answers

I pace the phrase like razorblades in figure skates
Slip the gate, the signal waits, it hisses, then it integrates
Interlaced with inner strafe—I pivot, make the rhythm quake
Dinner plate is paper-thin; I feed on every little break

[FX cue – phone-filter vox for 2 bars]
Budget cuts and busted buses, routes erased like names on desks
Neighbors juggle double shifts, the struggle’s humming in their chests
Lobby gilded, copper peeling, policy that palms the rest
I don’t flex with petty chains, I chain the petty laws that press

[Hook – call-and-response, leader pitched low; responders clean]
Leader: Dark phonk doctrine, coffin-deep drums knocking
Crowd: Coffin-deep drums knocking
Leader: Voice warps morph, then we torch false options
Crowd: Torch those options
Leader: Scratch-blade boxing, vinyl ghosts talking
Crowd: Ghosts keep talking
All: If the gate stays locked, we pick it with the dropping

[Breakdown – tape stop, subs duck, whisper layers]
Whispers in the wire, winds in the cones
Dinner with desire, grit in the tone
Winner isn’t hired, winner is grown
Printer jams the liars, ink overthrown

[Bridge – antiphonal duet, panned left/right]
Left: Sinkhole syllables, city full of intervals
Right: Interval criminals pickpocketing principles
Left: Pinnacles minimal, win is indivisible
Right: Cynical generals, spin into residuals
Both: We bend the metronome till justice isn’t mythical

[Scratch solo – rapid flares, transforms, baby-scratches, one backspin]

[Verse 3 – chest-voice grit, slow menace, compressed breaths]
I keep the diction friction-hot, the diction plots a spark in fog
Park the slog, then march the block, the drums are dogs that bark at gods
Archive scars inside these bars; they guard my heart when audits start
Augur art from carbon parts, I carve the dark and chart the arc

Needle digs the fossil groove, the gospel moves through copper tubes
Hospitals with hallway blues, the lobby suits say “follow rules”
But hollow rules don’t feed the schools, we tweak the tools, we seed the truth
Beat the booth like beating proof from idols glued to see-through roofs

[FX stack – vocoder pad bed, octave-dropped ad-libs tucked]
Breadlines underline the headlines, deadlines weaponize
Red lights settle on the redlines legislators set aside
We thread mines: careful steps in serif text they advertise
My pen’s a lens that bends events until the center clarifies

[Hook – full-stack, add choir sample low, sidechain pump]
This is dark phonk doctrine, coffin-deep drums knocking
Voice warps morph, then we torch false options
Scratch-blade boxing, vinyl ghosts talking
If the gate stays locked, we pick it with the dropping

[Tag – chopped vox, half-time]
Knock—knock—knock—knock (bassline)
Break—that—lock—right—off (bassline)

[Outro – record hiss solo, power-down hum]
Let the stylus find the silence where the sirens rested
Let the violence in the wires turn to quiet lessons
When the mains click cold and the room stops pressing
We’ll still write code in the drum’s confession
