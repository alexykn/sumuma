[Intro – cowbell lead, tape hiss, vinyl crackle]
[Scratch fills: short cuts on beat 4]
[Voice FX: low formant ad‑libs left; telephone EQ whispers right]
Night slides in like smoke through the blinds
Red tail-lights paint slow curves on my thigh
Engine purr, my pulse keeps time
Tick—tick—tick, that bell don’t lie

[Verse 1 – close mic, intimate breath]
Lip gloss taste like midnight wine
Lean in closer, trace that line
808 growls, it bites the spine
I bend the note, you lose your mind

Velvet hush, I say your name
Heat on glass draws crooked flames
Hands on hips, we move the frame
Low light sins, we love the blame

[Pre-Hook – widen doubles, slight chorus]
Cowbell talking sweet in the dark
Two-step slide, we spark
Bass so dirty leave a mark
Kiss the beat, leave teeth marks

[Hook – big, simple, repeatable; stacked harmonies]
Tick, tock, cowbell knock
Slow grind, city locked
Bend low, let it drop
Say my name, don’t stop

Tick, tock, cowbell knock
Smoke rings, window fogged
Heart drum, bass throb
Say my name, don’t stop

[Post-Hook – scratch riff + reversed vox]
[Scratch call-and-response with chopped “say my name”]
[Reverse swell into Verse 2]

[Verse 2 – husky lead, octave-doubled below]
Gold chain swing on the four and the eight
I ride the groove, never showing my haste
Sweet venom drip on the tip of the taste
You chase the echo while I’m setting the pace

Silhouette sway in the violet glow
I flick the switch, watch the filter close
Hands in the air but the room feels low
I open up just enough, then slow

[Breakdown – formant-shift ad‑libs, filtered drums]
[Cowbell solo pattern: tick–tick–rest, tick–rest–tick]
[Bass: band-pass sweep, gritty distortion]
Mmm, mmm, mmm… breathe in my smoke
Mmm, mmm, mmm… bend till it broke

[Hook – return, add call-and-response]
Tick, tock, cowbell knock
Slow grind, city locked
Bend low, let it drop
Say my name, don’t stop

[Call] Say my—
[Response] Name
[Call] Say my—
[Response] Name

[Alt Hook – half-time, airy stacks, widened reverb]
Tick… tock… bell in the night
Low… slow… keeping it tight
Pull… close… under the light
Say… my… name till it bites

[Outro – tape stop, vinyl pop, whispered tags]
[Scratch tail: fade out with micro-cuts]
Tick—tock… tick—tock… don’t stop
Say my name… don’t stop
