[Intro – Distant PA Chime + Vinyl Crackle]
[sample: "attention... closing..."] [ghosted, looped under hiss]
Emergency lights blink like tired eyelids, red on chrome
Escalators sigh, teeth grinding bone on bone
Sneakers echo, hollow halo, glass like snow
Mannequin faces watch me breathe in broken glow

[Verse 1 – Liminal Drift, Half-Whisper]
Food court fossils, ketchup stains turn rusted runes
Court of appeals with pigeons perched on plastic spoons
Memory mall map folded, edges cut my thumb
I trace the faded arrow: you are here, become
Coin fountain dry, pennies grin with greenish shame
Wishbones bit to copper, nothing's granted, only names
Loading docks, locks popped, stockroom ghosts in chain
Roll-up doors like ribcages creak in aching rain
I pocket tokens, chuckle tokens, choking jokes
Head full of coupon thunder, thunder under smoke
Detuned bells drip, melt over 808s that groan
Every sale sign peels back secrets, stick to bone

[Pre-Hook – Sirens Far Away]
Neon bleeding through the cracks, it hums my sins
Photo booth strip whispers, half-smiles, phantom grins
Glass-eyed security lens blinks, then begins
To track my silhouette, stutter-step within

[Hook – Distorted, Submerged]
I got ghosts in the atrium, price tags on their throats
They float when the bass hits, swallow dust like notes
If the ceiling starts to ripple, I'm a swim through smoke
In a dark slow maze where the echoes wrote
I got ghosts in the atrium, barcode scars that sting
When the gates drop clattering, hear the turnstiles sing
Let the detuned choir drag my name through tin
If the lights cut out, I still glow within

[Verse 2 – Broken Fluorescents, Clipped Delivery]
Food court fortune teller, straw wrapper origami fate
Says the wish you saved got traded for a metal gate
I wear a mirrored mask, see myself as aisle eight
Marked down twice, chalked price, smile taped straight
Cart wheels squeal symphonic, sparks kiss tile
I wade through perfume rivers, stale for miles
Kiosk hawkers frozen mid-pitch, glassy trial
Their scripted breath condensed into brittle vials
I press ear to a shutter, hear the mall's old lungs
Harmonic wheeze of freon, frets on rusted tongues
My pulse becomes the intercom's robotic hums
Clean up on a dream, spilled youth, aisle one

[Bridge – Weightless Drop, Reversed Reverb]
[tape wind: rewind, unwind] [wide, swallowed]
I remember soft pretzels, sugar storms, coin flip fights
Now it’s ratchet straps and flashing hazard lights
We trade summer in for the sodium night
And wear returns like coats that never fit right

[Hook – Distorted, Submerged]
I got ghosts in the atrium, price tags on their throats
They float when the bass hits, swallow dust like notes
If the ceiling starts to ripple, I'm a swim through smoke
In a dark slow maze where the echoes wrote
I got ghosts in the atrium, barcode scars that sting
When the gates drop clattering, hear the turnstiles sing
Let the detuned choir drag my name through tin
If the lights cut out, I still glow within

[Verse 3 – Low Register, Underwater]
Food court flags sag, grease halos crown the air
Arcade coughs one life left, blinking dare
I spend it on a rumor that the skylight tears
Open when the kick hits, pouring velvet stairs
I climb them on a rhythm made of squeaks and grit
Every step a receipt, heat-printed bit by bit
I’m a mall-walker midnight, vinyl jacket split
Where the mannequins mimic my limp and wit
Static kisses every consonant, the vowels smear tar
I park my past in a bankrupt boutique jar
Shake it like a snow globe full of old gift cards
Watch it flurry, blurry, mercy, marred

[Outro – PA Heartbeat + Distant Thunder]
[sample: "thank you for shopping..."] [pitched down, decayed]
If the locks learn my name, let the locks sing along
If the tiles crack a rhythm, let the cracks be the song
When the roof exhales darkness, I inhale it strong
Till the sale on my shadow says gone, gone, gone
