[Intro — tape-warped vox, vinyl crackle, HPF sweep, distant siren]
[Scratch: chopped newscasts — words cut up: "off", "air", "silence"]
[Pitch-down ad‑libs tucked under tempo]
Static in the headlines, static in my headspace
Budget buys the bright lights, bodies in the dead space
Signal starves the dark feed, buffered truth in deadpan
If the cameras fear the night, I’ll light it with a red scan

[Hook — layered unison + formant‑shifted low double, stereo widen, scratch fills]
They don’t televise the quiet wars, ghosted on the ticker
Clickbait sips the sugar, but the bitter bleeds thicker
If the algorithm buries it, I dig with splintered fingers
Where the ash won’t wash and the echo stain lingers

[Verse 1 — aggressive cadence, dense internals, slight overdrive on lead]
I don’t chant for ratings, I exhume what’s under pages,
Where the syndicates syndicate the sanitized stages.
Broken cables, brokered fables, focus catered to the safest,
While a border town’s a furnace and the footage stays faceless.
Cobalt in the Kivus, kids sift rivers into splinters,
Mothers knuckle winter, whispers thin as paper printers.
Tigray threads frayed—grain bins bleed into the dust,
Ceasefire signed in captions, calibers still cough rust.
Taiz to Hodeidah—airless rooms, Yemen’s lungs,
Walls hum low with drones, empty bowls, bitten tongues.
Khartoum’s nights bloom smoke—streets sweep names in chalk,
Reporters lose the uplink, rumors do the talk.
Rakhine shoreline—boats burn, maps blur into erasure,
Myanmar pages folded, bayonets edit the paper.
Papua—black sand, vans unmarked, masks in mirrors,
Palm-oil bribes, a guard’s nod, land deeds shredded thinner.
Anglophone in Bamenda, blackouts black the faces,
Cameroon thunder murmurs where the wire never traces.
Karabakh, corridors closed, convoys starve in queues,
Then the feed flips back to sneakers, streaming views.

[Pre‑Hook — phone EQ + chorus on backs, record hiss]
If the trendline trims the truthline down to single digits,
We’ll engrave the names in basslines, make the needle witness.

[Hook — layered unison + formant‑shifted low double, stereo widen, scratch fills]
They don’t televise the quiet wars, ghosted on the ticker
Clickbait sips the sugar, but the bitter bleeds thicker
If the algorithm buries it, I dig with splintered fingers
Where the ash won’t wash and the echo stain lingers

[Verse 2 — double-time pockets, chopped ad‑libs (low), scratch stabs between bars]
Mali into Burkina, lines redraw with desert wind,
Sahel drums in minor, metal hums where markets spin.
Blue helmets blot the skyline, mandates thin as gauze,
Bandits wrote the bylaws with a muzzle on the cause.
Haiti—roads barricaded, radio bitten by the static,
Names under the shattered glass, maps manic, math erratic.
Oromia—earth opens, villages fold into a rumor,
Numbers blink and vanish in a spreadsheet’s gray tumor.
Kashmir—snow hush, slow crush under curfew-colored dawn,
Signal throttled, posts throttled, prayer carpets carry yawned.
Western Sahara—salt flats, flags fade under sandstorms,
Referendum sleeps while the checkpoint forms anthologies of uniforms.
Balochistan—rail cut, wells dry, dusk swallows number plates,
Journal entries end in ellipses, exits hide behind the gates.
Goma night shift—miners cough a copper ghost from lungs,
Supply chains rinse their hands and pass a thousand gleaming thumbs.
Refugee camp rain, tent seams leak a second sky,
Aid trucks lost in paperwork that’s weaponized to dry.
I don’t aim a lens for laurels, I engrave the unheard psalms,
Let the 808 distort, report the fault lines in their palms.

[Bridge — vocoder choir, formant slides, tempo halved, LPF fade]
Say their towns, say their tongues, let the bass remember,
Hold a list between the kicks until the cold embers simmer.

[Hook — last: add octave-up ghost, widen, heavy scratches crossfade]
They don’t televise the quiet wars, ghosted on the ticker
Clickbait sips the sugar, but the bitter bleeds thicker
If the algorithm buries it, I dig with splintered fingers
Where the ash won’t wash and the echo stain lingers

[Outro — vinyl stop, sample chopped: “off… air…”; tape echo into silence]
Static in the headlines, static in my headspace,
Put the names inside the bassline so the dead stay traced.
