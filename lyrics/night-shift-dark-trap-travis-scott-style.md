[Intro – Heavy Auto-Tune + Distorted Vocal Chops]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Night shift in my head, can't escape the maze (—auto-tune heavy—)
Lost inside the static, purple in the haze [delay 1/4 note, pitch -12 cents]

[Verse 1 – Auto-Tune + Vocal Layering, Slow Flow]
Codeine dreams dripping through my conscience slow
Neon signs reflecting off the H-town glow (internal: slow/glow)
Phantom in the rearview, ghosts of what I used to know
Now I'm moving different, energy below zero (AABX pattern)

Purple rain falling on my leather interior  
Lost boys in the lobby, faces getting eerier
Bass so low it's shaking up my sterior
While I'm floating through dimensions, feeling so superior

(—vocal chop: "can't escape"—) [pitched down, granular delay]

[Hook – Stacked Harmonies + Heavy Processing]
Night shift, night shift, working through the pain [auto-tune +octave harmony]
Mind tricks, mind tricks, driving me insane (—reverb cathedral, 4s decay—)
Can't shift, can't shift, nothing feels the same [vocal layers: -5, 0, +7 cents]
I'm in the matrix, stuck inside the game

(Yeah!) [dry vocal, no processing]
(Straight up!) [distorted, bit-crushed]

[Verse 2 – Fragmented Flow + Vocal Textures]
Chrome rims spinning in the parking lot asphalt
Demons in my DMs, telling me it's all my fault (internal: asphalt/fault)
Memory foam mattress but my mind can't find a halt
While I'm sipping something purple, taste like liquid cobalt

She said "where you been?" I said "trapped inside my thoughts"
Took her to the penthouse, showed her all the stuff I bought (—vocal double, panned L+R—)
But material possessions never filling up the spots
Where my soul supposed to be, now it's tangled up in knots

(—ad-lib: "yeah, yeah, it's lit"—) [auto-tune, delay dotted 1/8]

[Bridge – Ethereal Vocals + Atmospheric Processing]
Floating through the clouds, can't tell what's up or down [whispered, heavy reverb]
Purple smoke surrounding, feet don't touch the ground
(—sample: "lost in the sauce"—) [pitched down 2 octaves, filtered]
Heart rate elevated but I'm moving super slow [vocal chop, granular synthesis]
In this simulation, never know which way to go

[Hook – Stacked Harmonies + Heavy Processing]
Night shift, night shift, working through the pain [auto-tune +octave harmony]
Mind tricks, mind tricks, driving me insane (—reverb cathedral, 4s decay—)
Can't shift, can't shift, nothing feels the same [vocal layers: -5, 0, +7 cents]
I'm in the matrix, stuck inside the game

(Yeah!) [dry vocal, no processing]
(Straight up!) [distorted, bit-crushed]

[Outro – Vocal Disintegration + Ambient Textures]  
Night shift fading into morning light [auto-tune subtle, pitch drift]
But I'm still trapped inside this endless night
(—vocal dissolve: heavy modulation, filter sweep—)
Purple haze consuming everything in sight [final vocal: grain delay, feedback 85%]
(La flame...) [whispered, heavily processed, fading]

[Production Notes]
- 808s tuned to D, heavy distortion and compression
- Vocal pitch correction set to minor pentatonic for Travis Scott character
- Heavy use of granular delay on ad-libs
- Cathedral reverb on all lead vocals, 4-5 second decay
- Vocal layers: main take center, harmony +7 cents right, sub-harmony -5 cents left
- Trap hi-hats with triplet rolls, filtered sweeps on buildup sections
