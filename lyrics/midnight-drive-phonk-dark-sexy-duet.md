[Intro – Tape Hiss + Cowbell Count‑in]
(vinyl scratch… shh) (cowbell: tik… tik… tik)
[low‑passed pad swell, filtered radio vox]

[Verse 1 – Female, Smoky + Intimate]
Red lights, chrome shine, lips taste like wine
Slow roll, low road, let the night draw lines
Cowbell calling me closer, heartbeat in time
Shadow on your collar, I’m crossing that sign
[subtle chorus double, breathy ad‑libs]

[Pre‑Chorus – Female + Pitched‑Down Ad‑Libs]
Slide to the side, let it ride, don’t speak
808 breathing, bass heat on my cheek
(male vox: pitched‑down “uh‑huh”) (scratch: k‑k‑k)
[formant shift on last word]

[Hook – Female Lead, Simple + Memorable]
Midnight, take me for a drive
Cowbell keep the time, keep the time
Distort my name, make it thrive
Say it, say it, slow and wide
[repeat last line 2x with harmony stack]

[Post‑Hook – Scratch Fill + Bass Growl]
(scratch: wicka‑wicka) (bass: grrr)
[short echo throw on “wide”]

[Verse 2 – Male, Laid‑Back Gravel]
Windows fog, city hum under neon signs
Two hearts sync to the kick when the low end climbs
I move when you move, keep it clean, keep it grime
Hands off the wheel, let the groove steer time
[telephone EQ for first 2 bars, open up on 3]

[Build – Both, Call + Response]
She: Pull me close, don’t rush
He: I’m right here, no hush
She: Heat rises, hush hush
He: 808 crush, crush
[cowbell pattern doubles, riser noise]

[Hook – Female Lead + Male Octave]
Midnight, take me for a drive
Cowbell keep the time, keep the time
Distort my name, make it thrive
Say it, say it, slow and wide
[male under: “slow and wide” one‑word echoes]

[Drop – Distorted Bass + Vocal Chop]
(vocal chop: “mid‑night… drive… drive”) (scratch stabs)
[cowbell halftime for 2 bars, then back full]

[Bridge – Whisper Stack + Formant Play]
Whisper my name, bend it low, bend it high
Pitch me in shadows, let the echoes collide
Tape kiss the edges, let the sweet distort glide
[formant shift female up 3 semitones on “high”, down 3 on “low”]

[Hook – Final, Big Harmonies + Ad‑Libs]
Midnight, take me for a drive
Cowbell keep the time, keep the time
Distort my name, make it thrive
Say it, say it, slow and wide
(male ad‑lib: “ride… ride…”) (scratch fill)
[stacked thirds + octave, gentle plate reverb]

[Outro – Fade With Cowbell + Hiss]
Low lights, no words, just signs
808 heartbeat under skyline lines
(vinyl crackle) (cowbell: tik… tik… fade)
[filter sweep down, stereo delay tails]
