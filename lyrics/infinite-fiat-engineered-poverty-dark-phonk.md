[Intro – dusty cassette hiss, vinyl crackle, detuned choir pad]
[Voice: pitched-down growl layered with formant-shifted whisper]
[Scratch FX: "money printer go— go— go—" chopped]
Clock hands cough in the gutter where the neon leaks
Ledger’s led astray, numbers pray while the people sleep
Mint breath, ink sweats, press kissin’ every sheet
No ceiling on the ceiling, only ceilings where we eat

[Drop-in Ad-libs – robotic octave dub, stereo ping]
Spin doctrine like a dreidel while the rent spins teeth
Quant ease grease palms, streets seize, lungs wheeze cheap
Credit chains clack like cuffs on the mezzanine
They engineered the famine, then they televised the feast

[Hook – stacked gang vox, slight overdrive, tight slap delay]
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
Paper waterfalls while the pantry’s desolate
Digits duplicate, futures indefinite
But they architect the drought, keep the thirst indefinite
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
We print the sky, still ration the filament
Bills proliferate, prisons enumerate
If the well is bottomless, why the fences syndicate?

[Turntable Fill – reverse cymbal into needle burn]

[Verse 1 – double-time pocket, gritty consonants]
Statisticians with scissors, cut reality to fit it
Graph axes relax as they ax the committed
Spreadsheet scepters bless debt as a sacrament
While the landlord choir hums hymns of the cabinet
Glossy white papers hide the ash in the cabinets
Brand-new policies, same locks on the tenements
Austerity theater: velvet rope, rope burns
The poor learn to juggle co-pays and slow burns
Payday loan lures, small print like a snake skin
Rates fanged, faith hanged, hope thin—break-in
Work shifts into grave shifts, graves into basements
Faces pixelate in the glow of replacements
Coins rain in the clouds, ground stays droughted
News says merit made it—truth says routed
Algorithmic alms toss crumbs to the timeline
But the loaf’s in a boardroom guarded by the skyline

[Hook – call/response, male low + female airy layer]
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
Paper waterfalls while the pantry’s desolate
Digits duplicate, futures indefinite
But they architect the drought, keep the thirst indefinite
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
We print the sky, still ration the filament
Bills proliferate, prisons enumerate
If the well is bottomless, why the fences syndicate?

[Bridge – lowpass the beat, isolate bass growl, whisper ad-libs]
Ink from the empire drips black into daylight
Whistles in cages sing bars about the stage lights
Truth scribbled on a napkin gets confiscated
The chorus of the punished stays syncopated

[Scratch Interlude – chop syllables: "print / spend / debt / chain"]

[Verse 2 – heavier swing, distorted doubles]
They broke the gold window, welded spreadsheets thrones
Kings of the keystroke crow from their phones
Fractions on fractions, phantom transactions
Ghost-backed notes with a hunger for captions
Policy poets write sonnets for the stock graph
While mothers skip dinner, make a meal of the long math
Ceilings made of glass? Nah, ceilings made of passwords
Gatekeep the gatekeepers, passwords guard passwords
Index climbs, food line bends like a back does
Pundits push pearls while the backbone fractures
Engineered scarcity, blueprints in the margins
Drafted in a language where hunger is a jargon
Sirens serenade the blocks like a violin
Violence in silence: empty pots, quiet violins
Hands up for wages that won’t meet the rent due
Hands down when the cameras pan to the pent view

[Hook – full stack, chorus widened, extra harmonics]
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
Paper waterfalls while the pantry’s desolate
Digits duplicate, futures indefinite
But they architect the drought, keep the thirst indefinite
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
We print the sky, still ration the filament
Bills proliferate, prisons enumerate
If the well is bottomless, why the fences syndicate?

[Breakdown – tape stop, bass solo growl, breath FX]
Count it, they mount it, accountants announce it
Announce it, then bounce it, the public denounces
But headlines sanitize the red lines, recount it
Till famine’s just a metric where executives pounce it

[Verse 3 – quiet-to-loud crescendo, choir stabs]
Weaving every wage into a web of arrears
Where the poor pay interest on invisible gears
If the note is a note, then the song is a cell
Bars in the staves, stave off the swell
They mint myths: “discipline, tighten your belt”
While their belts wrap the world like an asteroid belt
Policy paladins parry with parables sterile
Meanwhile the mirror screams back at the peril
I saw a pen turned weapon when a truth-teller wrote
And the state turned the page into shackles on throats
But a whisper through cracks can erode any vault
When the crowd keeps the count and the count calls the fault

[Hook – final, choir + crowd chant, kick-sidechain pump]
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
Paper waterfalls while the pantry’s desolate
Digits duplicate, futures indefinite
But they architect the drought, keep the thirst indefinite
Money infinite, hunger deliberate
We print the sky, still ration the filament
Bills proliferate, prisons enumerate
If the well is bottomless, why the fences syndicate?

[Outro – vinyl runout, lo-fi hiss, vocoder prayer]
If wealth is a well with no bottom in sight
Why do we learn to love living without light?
If the press never sleeps and the paper don’t end
Why do we dream of a debt we can’t mend?
