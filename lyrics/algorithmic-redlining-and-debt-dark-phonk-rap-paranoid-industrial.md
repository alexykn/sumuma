[Intro – Tape Hiss, Vinyl Crackle, Sub rumble]
[Voice pitched down, slight bitcrush]
Night shift, light drip, data drips in the gutter
Credit script glitches, debt cuffs click like a shutter
Ghost in the wire with a wiretap grin
Algorithmic choir singing sin for a spin

[Scratch FX – backspin cue]

[Hook – Call/Response, Double-tracked, Distorted Bass Swell]
They set the terms, then turn the screws (turn it)
Score the poor, then burn the fuse (burn it)
Ghosted doors where loans refuse (learn it)
Black-box gods choose who’ll lose (earn it)
Say: pay, pray, pledge your proof
Faceprint stamped on the landlord’s roof
Click, scrape, trade your truth
Every breath weighed, then shaved from the tooth

[Verse 1 – Aggressive cadence, slight pitch-down, tight slap delay]
Ledger-etched futures, futures hedged on a hunch
Crunch time, crunch line, feeding credits for lunch
Creditors edit us, predicates petty as cuffs
Prettiest rhetoric shredded when the metric is rough
Hood heuristics mark harvest targets
Carted to markets by arsonous varmints
Redline parallax, maps with the scarlet
Apartment apartheid wrapped in a charter
Blue-lit room, cursor bruised, eyelids numb
Fine-print vines where the wild debts run
Dial-tone drone like a choir of guns
Ping from the phone—another trial, we’re shunned
Payday trap with the payday rap
APR fangs in a grayscale app
Terms so long it can break your back
Tap “agree,” watch the daylight crack
Skull full of spreadsheets, teeth grit, deep bit
Bleed bits, seed lists, names on a cheap list
C-level devils with bezel-thick briefcases
Pre-case evictions in pre-labeled brief statements

[Scratch FX – “Pay… pay… pay…” chopped]

[Pre-Hook – Phone Filter, Tight Reverb]
Sign on the dotted in dotted-line dusk
Trust gets audited, honest minds rust
Knife in the fiber, a fiber-optic musk
Dust in the BIOS, a bias built to crush

[Hook – Main, Crowd Layers, Sub boost]
They set the terms, then turn the screws (turn it)
Score the poor, then burn the fuse (burn it)
Ghosted doors where loans refuse (learn it)
Black-box gods choose who’ll lose (earn it)
Say: pay, pray, pledge your proof
Faceprint stamped on the landlord’s roof
Click, scrape, trade your truth
Every breath weighed, then shaved from the tooth

[Verse 2 – Duo Trade-Off, Formant Shift on ad-libs]
I see the spreadsheet preacher peeking through the peephole
Preaching “risk,” reaching for a repo on the people
Default folklore, coded in a cold war
Bold score sold door-to-door like folklore
Siloed data brokers broker broken halos
Halo turns to gallows when the payload follows
Shadow-banned boroughs with borrowed tomorrow
Barcodes narrow the marrow you swallow
Second voice: static growl, gravel in the vowels
Snatch savings, drain veins, tally with a scowl
Auto-deny, auto-apply, audit the crowd
Autopsy the wallet while the wallet stays loud
We built a signal out of splinters from the outages
Routed through the doubt, we found routes around the savages
Barnacle the banks, we anchor where the power is
Counter the accountant while he counts up our inheritances

[Scratch Break – DJ cuts “deny, approve, remove”]

[Bridge – Melodic chant under vocoder, Distorted 808 sustain]
Who got the map of the maze to the safe?
Who got the black box key to the gate?
Who got the hands on the rate, on the fate?
We got the lockpick tongue and the rage in the bass
Clip the clause, rip the cause, flip the laws
Grip the jaws of the rigged applause
Run the meters till the readers fog
Hum the heaters till the leaders jog

[Hook – Alt Take, Heavier saturation, Wider stereo]
They set the terms, then turn the screws (turn it)
Score the poor, then burn the fuse (burn it)
Ghosted doors where loans refuse (learn it)
Black-box gods choose who’ll lose (earn it)
Say: pay, pray, pledge your proof
Faceprint stamped on the landlord’s roof
Click, scrape, trade your truth
Every breath weighed, then shaved from the tooth

[Verse 3 – Final Barrage, Fast triplet pockets, Glitch stutters]
Dead-end debit embedded in the edit log
Credit fog, frosted across the fetid bog
Meta cog spins while the kettle gnaws
Settle scores scored in a rental clause
Heat map red where the hopes go blue
Loop back dread when the scope’s on you
Booth gas lit by the ghosted queue
Truth tax hit when the post goes through
Counterfeit empathy, sandbox sympathy
“Scalable empathy”—empty as infantry
Marching on margins, carving our history
Cartridge of barcodes, arch it in mimicry
But we—break norms with a waveform blade
Storm through the swarm with a form that fades
Warm up the floor as the floorboard caves
Score stays raw when the warlord pays

[Outro – Tape Stop, Vinyl slow-down, Whispered doubles]
Shh—cut the feed, let the meters bleed
If the code won’t bend, then the streets will lead
We don’t owe their omen or their broken creed
We sow our own—then we own the seed
