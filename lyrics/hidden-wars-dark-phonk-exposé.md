[Intro – Distorted bass drone + vinyl crackle | whispered doubles | formant-down lead | bitcrush tails]
Static in the teeth, metal in the marrow, hush
City hums in monochrome, rumor on the bus
Off the record, off the radar, off the blessed trust
Off the schedule, off the chyron, off the sponsors’ thrust

[Hook – Pitched‑down unison + scratch replies]
They don’t televise the fault lines, just the headline floods
They don’t monetize the long wars, only trending blood
They don’t algorithm the ghosts, only saleable mud
Turn the dial, hear the hiss — truth undercut, undercut

[Verse 1 – Broken flow, half‑whispered, tape wow | ad‑libs: pitched up]
Dead maps in the dashboard, borders bend like reeds
Budget smoke in the stockrooms, war becomes a feed
Ukraine on the scroll, but the chorus hides the reeds
Tigray starves in the margins, famine folded in the reeds
Kivu night fires, cobalt in a child’s sleeve
Yemen coughs kerosene lullabies the lungs can’t leave
Sahel grits its molars while a drone draws eaves
Kalash rain, cash grain — famine markets weave
Haiti hears a siren stitched with diesel and belief
Burkina’s dusty rumors bloom to armored grief
Myanmar’s midnight knocks, neighbors speak in teeth
Papua whispers names that sink below the reef
Press kits polish nothing into ocean‑spray relief
Angles, anchors, ad buys, cutaway to brief
“Balance” like a ballast made of hollowed out relief
Cut the talent mic — the violence edits grief

[Scratch Break – DJ cuts: "off the record" / "static sells" / "don’t look there"]
Off the record — static sells — don’t look there
Off the record — static sells — don’t look there

[Hook – Call‑and‑response with vocoder bed]
They don’t televise the fault lines, just the headline floods
[Response – robotic choir] Fault lines, fault lines, buried in the mud
They don’t monetize the long wars, only trending blood
[Response – robotic choir] Long wars, lost wars, never make the cut

[Verse 2 – Double‑time syllables, ring‑mod grit | backings: phone‑EQ]
Carousels of casualty math, rounded off to none
Ticker tape confetti hides artillery in the sun
Parliament of algorithms, hands wash, funds run
Cameras love the spectacle, cut corners, spin spun
Archives blink 404 at every unglam gun
Detonations with no nation, paperwork undone
Karabakh in the throat, throat clears, segment done
Darfur’s dust drags on shoes no courier will run
Coltan, cotton, copper — coffins under ton
Supply chains braid veins — profits never stun
Syllables in syllabaries never reach the bun
Editors in elevators, floors above the stun
Eyelines, bylines, deadlines — blinds lower, sun
Sold out to the slots where the soft focus won

[Micro‑Hook – Whispered stack + tape stop]
Undercover undercurrent, undertow in trust
Underloved, underfunded, truth undercut, undercut

[Bridge – Radio intercept | detuned choir pads]
[List, chanted softly]
Goma, Juba, Sana’a, Aleppo back‑alleys
Kashmir winters, Khartoum alleys, Kabul valleys
Ituri midnight, Tripoli sirens, Lagos rallies
Silence sells the airtime; suffering doesn’t tally

[Verse 3 – Call‑and‑response cadences | formant‑shifts | stereo doubles]
Name the storm without a sponsor, [Ad‑lib] name the sponsor of the storm
Name the bone behind the billboard, [Ad‑lib] bones become the norm
Name the page that turned to pixels, [Ad‑lib] pixels never mourn
Name the stage that loves a hero, [Ad‑lib] villains get reform?
If a child counts shells like sheep, who edits out the yawn?
If a mother learns to stitch a wound before the dawn?
If a village learns to whisper louder than a bomb?
Will a chyron learn to widen past a single harm?

[Hook – Full stack, distortion bloom]
They don’t televise the fault lines, just the headline floods
They don’t monetize the long wars, only trending blood
They don’t algorithm the ghosts, only saleable mud
Turn the dial, hear the hiss — truth undercut, undercut

[Outro – LPF fade, cassette hiss, scratched vox]
Off the record, off the record, truth under the crust
Off the record, off the record, trust turned to rust
Off the record, off the record, static in the lungs
Fade the light, feed the night — we unlearn what they’ve sung
