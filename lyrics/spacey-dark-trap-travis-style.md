[Intro – Atmospheric Pad + Vinyl Crackle]
(sample: "lost in the void...") [heavily auto-tuned, echo+reverb]
Yeah... yeah...
(ad-lib: "straight up")

[Verse 1 – Slow Flow, Auto-tuned + Pitch Shift]
Floating through dimensions, my mind's in a haze
Purple smoke ascending through these neon maze
Gravity ain't holding what I used to be
Shattered glass reflections of my memory
(—synth swell—)

Time moves in slow motion when I'm in this space
Chasing ghost emotions that I can't replace
Stars are getting closer but they feel so cold
Trading all my warmth for chains of liquid gold
(vocal processing: heavy auto-tune, formant shift down)

[Hook – Doubled Vocals, Wide Stereo + Heavy Effects]
Lost in the cosmos, can't find my way back
(back, back, back) [delay feedback 3x]
Drowning in darkness, everything's black
(black, black, black) [reverse reverb]
Swimming through stardust, floating through time
(—808 sub drop—)
Left all my demons in another lifetime
(vocal chop: "lifetime-time-time")

[Verse 2 – Whispered Delivery, Filtered + Ethereal]
Neon signs reflecting off my bloodshot eyes
City lights below me but I'm touching skies
Prescription bottle empty, now I'm feeling weightless
Conversations with the moon, she says I'm ageless
(—ambient texture—)

Phantom vibrations from a phone that ain't there
Searching for salvation in the midnight air
Used to have direction, now I'm spinning free
Gravitating toward what I'm not supposed to be
(ad-lib: "it's lit") [whispered, heavily processed]

[Bridge – Pitched Vocals + Orchestral Swell]
(sample: "falling through space...")
Can't tell if I'm rising or if I'm falling down
(down, down, down) [pitched vocals, octave drops]
Lost inside this feeling that I can't describe
(—strings crescendo—)
Dancing with my shadows in the ultraviolet light

[Hook – Layered Harmonies + Full Effects]
Lost in the cosmos, can't find my way back
(back, back, back) [delay feedback 3x]
Drowning in darkness, everything's black
(black, black, black) [reverse reverb]
Swimming through stardust, floating through time
(—massive 808 sub drop—)
Left all my demons in another lifetime
(vocal chop: "lifetime-time-time" + pitch bend)

[Outro – Fading Auto-tune + Ambient Decay]
Floating... floating...
(sample: "it's falling apart...")
Yeah... straight up...
(vocals fade with heavy reverb tail, 8-second decay)
