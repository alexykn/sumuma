[Intro – Sparse Guitar Loop + Vinyl Crackle]
(sample: distant city noise, 3am ambience) [filtered low, creates space]

[Verse 1 – Raw Delivery, Close Mic]
Three in the morning, got my demons on speed dial
Been mixing whiskey with my thoughts for a while
Your ghost still haunts this empty apartment hall
Echoing footsteps where you used to call

[Pre-Chorus – Building Tension]
And I'm drowning in the silence 
(breathing gets heavier) [subtle reverb increase]
Can't escape what's in my head

[Chorus – Blues Guitar Lead, Full Beat Drop]
So I'll burn it down, burn it down tonight
Let the ashes tell the story of our fight
In the smoke I see your face in neon light
Burn it down, burn it down, till nothing's left but spite
(guitar wail) [distorted, melancholic bend]

[Verse 2 – More Aggressive, Desperate]
Bathroom mirror shows a stranger's hollow eyes
Been chasing shadows, feeding comfortable lies
Your perfume lingers on these sheets I can't wash clean
Living in the wreckage of what we could have been

[Pre-Chorus – Building Again]
And I'm drowning in the silence
(voice cracks slightly) [raw emotion breaking through]
Can't escape what's in my head

[Chorus – Full Intensity]
So I'll burn it down, burn it down tonight
Let the ashes tell the story of our fight
In the smoke I see your face in neon light
Burn it down, burn it down, till nothing's left but spite

[Bridge – Minimal, Vulnerable]
(distant police sirens) [atmosphere, urban loneliness]
Maybe I'm just broken
Maybe I'm just scared
Of finding something real when nothing else compares
(guitar feedback grows) [building to climax]

[Final Chorus – Cathartic Release]
So I'll burn it down, burn it down tonight
Let the flames consume what's left of you and I
In the morning I'll rebuild from what survived
Burn it down, burn it down, till I'm alive
(guitar solo outro) [blues-rock emotional release]

[Outro – Fade to Morning Ambience]
(birds chirping, distant traffic) [new day beginning]
Dawn breaks through these blinds like hope I never knew
Maybe burning bridges leads to something new
