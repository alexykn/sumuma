92 BPM Dark Phonk - C Phrygian
Brutal half-time drive; triplet rap locked to sync 1/16-1/32 hats and cowbell. Sub slam under heavy sidechain (4:1, fast atk/med rel), stacked with distorted Reese + FM grind for low end. LFO wah-wub sweeps LPF<>res peaks for motion. Stutter edits splinter the groove; chopped vox, pitch shift, glitch resample. Pitch drops (-7/-12) plunge; stretched rises (+3/+7) wind tension. Multiband sat + parallel distort keep bass colossal yet controlled; transient shaping drives kick/snare/clap to violent clarity. 808 focus; variable tempo feels (micro ramps, half-time flips) but master clock 92.
