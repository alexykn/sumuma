128 BPM PROGRESSIVE TECHNO — A Minor Pentatonic
Cathedral shadows meet warehouse concrete—medieval melancholy through Berlin underground precision. Driving four-on-floor with monastery echoes in hypnotic architecture.

Juno 106 bass: fat wide analog warmth → compression → stereo spread. Medieval flute samples → vintage delay → ethereal texture. Kick: punchy analog → tight compression. Hats: crispy snap → rhythmic filtering. Pads: wide supersaw → cathedral reverb.

Builds basement intimacy to cathedral finale. Verses: driving rhythm + medieval fragments over Juno foundation. Chorus: progressive majesty with European melancholy. Medieval as ghostly echoes—never overpowering techno drive.

MIX + MASTER
