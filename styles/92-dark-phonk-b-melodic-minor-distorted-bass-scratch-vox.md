92 BPM dark phonk/hip-hop — B Melodic Minor
Basement-raw menace; Memphis tape ghosts, warehouse grit. Distorted 808 sub under dusty vinyl hiss; SP-1200 punch, MPC swing, crispy rims. DJ scratches slice in rhythmic retorts. Vox: gravelly lead with formant shift, tel-EQ, octave ad-libs, chopped shouts as perc; RTJ/Killer Mike cadence—baritone authority, tight internals, emphatic stops. Noir keys, detuned bells, eerie choir stabs; wobbling LPF sweeps, tape flutter.

Arrangement: cold open (crackle + bass growl) → verse drive → hook with chant gang vox + scratch fills → verse 2 adds bell motif → breakdown filter sweep → final hook stacked, clipped energy.
