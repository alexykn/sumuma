94 BPM Dark Phonk — D Phrygian
Memphis-night haze, trunk rattle. Cowbell motif drives the pocket; swung hats, ghost claps. Pounding 808, clipped attack; distorted bass glue, tape-sat kick. Sexy female rapper upfront: close-mic breath, light formant shift, chorus widen. Male voice answers: ad-libs, low-octave doubles, pitched growls. Scratch cuts punctuate; siren chops tucked low. Arrangement: hiss + scratches → hook, cowbell spotlight → verse A (F lead, M ad-libs) → hook variation, bell rhythm flipped → verse B (M doubles thicker) → breakdown, LPF 808 + filtered bells → final hook.
