78 BPM Dark Trap / Brazilian Phonk — C Natural Minor
Neon balada haze; SP nights x screw—robotic/glitch/psychedelic over humid ambience: seductive/powerful, cinematic/dreamy. Funk carioca undertones: tamborzão ghosts, swung claps; hypnotic pocket. Two switching melodies: dark emotive (detuned bends) and bright bouncy (glassy pluck). Deep 808s: distorted slides, long tails; kick/sub tight. Drums: crunchy kit; fast hats (stutters/triplets), clap flams; glitch fills. Vocals: chopped female PT‑BR, sung phrasing not spoken—soulful, hypnotic, sensual; formant/pitch chops as hooks. Arrangement: pad + lo‑fi vox intro → head‑nod drop; smooth transitions via reverse swells, filtered noise, tape stops. Energy: sparse verse → wide hook with bright motif + side‑chain pump; breakdown to sub + vox chops; return layered. Palette: Moog mono, Juno pads, FM bells; rhythmic gate. Mix/Master: analog warmth, deep low‑end, wide/clean, loud‑but‑breathing.
