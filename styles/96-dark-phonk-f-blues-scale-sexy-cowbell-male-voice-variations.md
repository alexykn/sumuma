96 BPM dark phonk — F Blues Scale
Memphis tape grit, neon menace. Cowbell leads a hypnotic hook. Pounding 808s, distorted sub under swung hats, claps, rims. Sexy female rapper upfront: breathy, close‑mic. Male vocal layers: call‑response ad‑libs, baritone doubles, whispered hype. Scratches mark transitions; vinyl hiss, stop/rewind. Voice‑alter FX: pitch/formant drifts, telephone band‑pass, light robotizer. Arrangement: intro hiss+scratch; verse (female lead); hook w/ male answers; breakdown w/ filtered drums + cowbell variant; verse 2 switch‑ups; tape‑stop outro.
