96 BPM Dark Phonk — D Blues Scale
Basement tape grit; hypnotic cowbell over slow drums. Pounding, distorted 808 with sidechain breath. Vinyl crackle + DJ scratches cut transitions. Sexy, smoky female lead; bluesy runs, close‑mic whispers. Voice‑altering: formant shifts, slight pitch drift, telephone hooks. Male vocal: ad‑libs, low doubles, spoken asides.

Arrangement: tape hiss → cowbell motif → drums+808 hit → verse (female lead, male ad‑libs) → scratch fill → hook widens (thick dbls) → breakdown (LPF sweep, cowbell vars) → final C&R → vinyl stop.
