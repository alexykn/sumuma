198 BPM Hard Gabber — C Locrian
Distorted industrial kicks lead, razor hats slice, aggressive bass chews the floor. but feral: haunting phrases stoke the build, then erupt into insane uptempo drops. Two interweaving leads anchor the hook: wide, fat Juno‑106 detuned saw + classic chorus (stereo), and a focused mid‑forward razor (digital wavetable/FM, mono). They trade calls, then lock into tight counterpoint so the melodies play with each other on top of the kick.

MIX + MASTER
Drums: clip sat → transients → parallel grit. Bass: tube → SC kick → HPF rumble. Juno: chorus → tape → hall. Razor: hard clip → slap → plate. Bus: glue → console → limiter.

Arrangement: filtered intro → riser (rave stabs/noise) → Drop A (lead call) → emotional breakdown (sub + pad) → Drop B (counterpoint, faster hats feel) → minimal outro. Twist: in Drop B, motif inversion—Juno up 1 octave mirrors the razor line while the center lead echoes the Juno hook staccato for a peak.
