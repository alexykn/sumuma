270 BPM hard gabber uptempo rave — C Natural Minor
Warehouse grit. Distorted industrial kicks upfront; razor hats; aggressive FM/Reese bass. Haunting minor lead adds tension. Flow: filtered kick rumble + noise → siren/riser stack → false drop (kick-only) → first uptempo drop with triplet fills and machine‑gun rolls. Breakdown: pad + bell plucks isolate theme, sub mutes; crowd‑chop whisper; rebuild via gated choir/noise → second drop with pitch‑rising kicks, call/response bass stabs. Hardcore anthem: ruthless drive, emotional release.

MIX + MASTER
Drums: 909/rumble stack, distortion → hard clip + parallel comp; tight low focus, HPF mud; hats bright with short room.
Bass: FM/Reese + tube warmth → strong sidechain to kick; mono lows, slight stereo dirt mid.
Lead/Atmos: detuned saw + metallic bell → dotted 1/4 delay, plate verb (HPF 300), filter sweeps.
Master: console glue + light tape → wide yet center‑solid; brickwall -0.1 dB, loud, keep transients.
