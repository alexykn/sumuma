72 BPM dark distorted trap — C Locrian
Nocturnal haze, late‑night Houston asphalt, woozy psychedelia, shadow‑club minimalism. Drums: blown‑out 808 subs (long tail, slight glide), crunchy rims, detuned claps, sparse hats with swung triplets and ghost rolls. Bass: sub first, layered mid growl; tube‑warmed, soft‑clipped, bends into drops. Synths: gloomy Juno‑style pads, bell plucks, eerie choir stabs, reversed guitar smears, formant‑shifted lead. Vocals: Travis Scott vibe—hazy Autotune croon, ad‑lib echoes, pitched doubles, breaths as texture, low‑passed intros, tape‑stop cuts. Arrangement: spacious intro → knock at bar 9 → minimal verse with negative space → pre‑hook lift via rising noise → hook with sub surge + wider pad → half‑time bridge with filter sweeps → final hook with added ad‑libs, surgical dropouts. FX: LPF sweeps, slapback accents, dark hall tails, sidechain pump to kick. Mix/Master: warm, bass‑forward, gritty, wide but controlled.
