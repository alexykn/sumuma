150 BPM DARK PHONK — G Melodic Minor
Brutal half‑time drive with triplet rap locked to syncopated hats and cowbell accents. Sub‑bass slams under hard SC to the kick, layered with distorted Reese and FM bass for grinding low‑end. LFO wah‑wub rides LPF throbs into resonant peaks for nonstop motion. Stutter edits splinter the groove; chopped vox, formant shifts, glitch resample sparks, and scratch cuts slice the mix. Pitch‑drops plunge to abyssal lows; rising stretches bend time and tension.

MIX + MASTER
Drums: 808 kit (punchy kick, crisp clap, tight cowbell) → transient shape + buss comp.
Bass: sub mono center → strong SC; Reese+FM parallel → MB sat + parallel dist for colossal yet controlled weight.
Lead/FX: LFO filter rides, tape‑stop, vinyl → short room + dub delay.
Master: console warmth + light tape, → clean limiter, loud/clear.

Arrangement: intro vox chop → drop (half‑time stomp) → triplet rap burst → filtered break → final drop with more grit.
